# Setting Up Private Amazon RDS Free Tier and Deploying Database Schema

This guide explains how to create a private Amazon RDS MySQL instance using the security group named `backend` (shared with your EC2 instance) and deploy your database schema and sample data using two SQL files: `schema.sql` and `demodata.sql`.

## Step 1: Sign in to AWS Management Console
- Go to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console)
- Sign in or create a new AWS account if you donâ€™t have one.
- Ensure you are eligible for the **AWS Free Tier** (available for 12 months for new accounts).

## Step 2: Launch a Private Amazon RDS MySQL Instance
1. Navigate to the **RDS** service from the AWS Console.
2. Click **Create database**.
3. Select **Standard Create**.
4. Choose **MySQL** as the engine.
5. Under **Templates**, select **Free tier**.
6. Configure settings:
   - DB instance identifier: e.g., `mydb-instance`
   - Master username: e.g., `admin`
   - Master password: set a strong password and remember it.
7. Keep default settings for DB instance size and storage (within free tier limits).
8. In **Connectivity**:
   - Select the same VPC where your EC2 instance resides.
   - Set **Public access** to **No** (making the database private).
   - Under **Security group**, select the existing security group named `backend`, which your EC2 uses.
9. Click **Create database** and wait for the instance status to be **Available**.

## Step 3: Configure Security Group for Access
- Confirm that the `backend` security group allows inbound traffic on port **3306** (MySQL) from within the VPC or from resources assigned to the same security group.
- This configuration ensures only your EC2 instances or other allowed backend resources can connect to the RDS instance, securing it from public traffic.

## Step 4: Connect to Your Private RDS Instance
- Retrieve the endpoint URL from the RDS dashboard (under your DB instance details).
- Since the database is private, connect from your EC2 instance or from a machine within the same VPC (e.g., via SSH tunnel).
- Use a MySQL client on your EC2 or local machine with proper networking setup:


- Enter the master password when prompted.

## Step 5: Create Database (Optional)
You may create a dedicated database before importing schema:


## Step 6: Deploy Schema and Sample Data
- Upload your `schema.sql` and `demodata.sql` files to your EC2 instance or the machine where you run the MySQL client.
- Execute the following commands in order:


## Step 7: Verify Tables and Data
Connect and verify your tables and data:

## Additional Notes
- AWS Free Tier includes 750 hours/month, 20GB storage, and specific instance types eligibility.
- A private RDS instance with a shared `backend` security group improves security by limiting access to your VPC backend resources.
- Always secure your database credentials and minimize inbound permissions in your security groups.
- Consider automation with AWS CLI, CloudFormation, or Terraform for production setups.

Your private, secure RDS database on AWS free tier is now ready, linked with your EC2 backend, with schema and data deployed via `schema.sql` and `demodata.sql`. Your application can safely connect using the `backend` security group.
